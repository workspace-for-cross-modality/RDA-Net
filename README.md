# RDA-Net: Relation-aware Dual-Attention Network for View-invariant Human Action Recognition.

 we propose a Relation-aware Dual-Attention Network (RDA-Net) for  view-invariant action recognition. The RDA-Net is compose of a  relation-aware self-attention module and a  cross-attention module. The  relation-aware self-attention module  learns representative and discriminative features that capture long-range dependencies and pair-wise relationships among human body parts/joints in the spatial and temporal channels. The cross-attention module is designed to learn view-invariant attention maps and generates discriminative features for a semantic representation of actions in different views.
